**Summary**

Experienced Principal Architect in Cisco's CTO team, part of the Customer Experience (CX) Organization in EMEA, with over 26 years at the company since joining in August 1998. I bring deep technical expertise in Network Management, Service Provider networks, and automation technologies, with a strong recent focus on energy optimization, telemetry, and data standardization across Cisco platforms.

I began my Cisco career in the TAC in Brussels, specializing in network instrumentation and programmability—core areas that have consistently guided my professional journey. As a member of the TAC Escalation team, I built foundational expertise that shaped my later work in automation, collaborating with customers across both Enterprise and Service Provider environments. My experience includes extensive support for third-party network management tools and Cisco solutions such as WAN Automation Engine (WAE), Network Services Orchestrator (NSO), and Cisco Network Registrar (CNR).

Beyond my core CX responsibilities, I have actively engaged in cross-functional initiatives with Cisco's Business Units, completing long-term rotations with the Validation Solutions (SVS) team and the WAE engineering group, now part of the MIG BU. I regularly present at Cisco Live and currently serve as Session Group Manager (SGM) for the EMEA event, leading tracks in Operations & Automation and Sustainability.

My recent work has focused on innovation and standardization, including leading patent efforts, contributing to IETF working groups (IVY and GREEN), and publishing with the IEEE. I was honored to lead the team that received the 2021 TSIA Innovation in Customer Success Award, and I currently serve on Cisco’s Patent Sustainability Committee.

Driven by a passion for engineering excellence and sustainability, I am eager to continue making an impact in roles that bridge technology and strategy—ideally as a Technical Marketing Engineer or Team Lead, where I can align cross-BU efforts and elevate Cisco’s leadership in network automation, manageability, and energy-efficient innovation.
